The course TMA4220 is a course on numerical solutions of differential equations with finite element methods.
In project 1 we develop the method and solve the solutions.
In project 2 we continue on the work from project 1 by optimizing the code and basically restructure it from scratch, so that it is able to solve the equations on much finer grids which gives more precision.
